# Spooky Language Repository

`Spooky` is a next-wave quantum programming idiom that draws its formalism and foundations from [homotopy type theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org/) and [higher inductive types](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/higher+inductive+type#:~:text=Higher%20inductive%20types%20(HITs)%20are,of%20its%20iterated%20identity%20types.).

This documentation is embryonic and will be improved in the future.

## How can I contribute to this project

Open source software is neither contagious nor a [cancer](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-no-we-dont-hate-open-source-software-and-we-can-prove-it/), as some narrow-minded people have said in the past!

We therefore encourage you to jump on the free software bandwagon and help us, through your contributions and your passion (which we hope will be as contagious as possible), to build this audacious project with our community.

"How can I contribute to this project", you may ask? First, we invite you to read carefully our [Contributor's Bible](./CONTRIBUTOR_BIBLE.md).

The second question you are probably asking yourself is "how can I be of help to this project"? Here are a few suggestions that come to mind:

- Sharing knowledge and know-how is crucial in such community-driven project. So why not helping us writing the documentation? This will give you a good understanding of the concepts and technology behind Sofair.

- If you're a passionate software engineer, why not contributing through coding? Some challenging tasks in cryptography, graph-based database, blockchain, networking, maths and more can challenge your neurons. Be sure that the core projec's team will always take care of onboarding newcommers with care, so that they feel comfortable contributing with us.

- And more...

The next concrete step is to take the plunge by picking one the outstanding tasks on the project's management board. For doing so, please bump to the [Getting started](./CONTRIBUTOR_BIBLE.md) paragraph of our `Contributor's Bible`.

If none of the above resonates with you, do not hesitate to send us an email at `contributors@spooky.codes`. You are sure to meet an open tribe eager to accept new ideas or contributions. Don't be shy!
